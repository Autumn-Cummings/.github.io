        For this project I had to create an original app and make 
        the screen designs for it. I decided to make a chat room app 
        for people specifically where the creators could be involved 
        with their audiences. They could directly communicate with their 
        communities and even let them know events they would attend, 
        when merchandise was released and any announcements they want 
        to release. There are many chat room apps out there but I wanted 
        mine to be one that was run by the creators. There would only be 
        the one verified chat instead of millions of chats created by 
        anyone where false information could be shared.
