        Every year, my High School’s drama club
        would reach out to the designers to make promotional art
        for their shows, we were given a short summary of the show 
        and all the information the show times and dates. 
        This show in particular is about 4 “Radium Girls”, 
        who were women that worked at watch companies, 
        where they eventually contracted radium poisoning. 
        The paint they used glowed in the dark and once it 
        had gotten into their bodies, their skin began to glow in the dark
         as well which is where I got the most inspiration for my design.
          I made 4 silhouettes of women that are glowing, surrounding them 
          is a glowing clock face, the clock nearing midnight is 
          meant to signify their time running out. Another huge part of
           the show is how much of a media frenzy this caused, 
           this inspired me to use a typeface similar to 
           typewriter newsprint to reflect this.
