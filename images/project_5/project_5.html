        For this project I had to design the information
        of a recipe as if it was in a cook book. I choose the 
        recipe that I make very often for me and my family which is 
        chocolate chip cookies. This project was a good experience of putting
        a lot of information onto a canvas and making it apeling and easy to read.
        I also loved this project for the plate of cookies I got at the end of it!
