        This project is very special to me since it was
        the invitation to my older sister's wedding.
        She gave me her list of what she wanted to see,
        and I got to work. On her list was of course, her information,
        their wedding colors which were pastel pink and grey, and roses.
        Since this was a very formal invitation, I decided to not use numbers
        for the time and address and instead wrote out the full words which the 
        bride and groom thought was a nice touch. This project was a great
        experience of being given exactly what the client wants, giving them
        more and seeing what works for them and what alterations I need to make 
        to create the perfect design for them.
